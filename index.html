                       <p class="about">+ When I was in high school, I did not have any idea whether I will study Information Technology or something related to Technology. At that time, the only thing that I want is that I would get a high mark on the national high school exam and win a place at a top-notch university in Vietnam. And I did it, I was in the top 1% of high-scoring students on that exam and luckily was eligible to study at an economics university which is Foreign Trade University. I was the one who like participating in clubs and doing other extra jobs besides studying at school. There is one thing that I had a chance to know, which is if I do a lot of jobs, I might not know what I like to work for a living in the future, but I will know what did not suitable for me. After a year at my former university, I realized that economics is not appropriate for me, I truly love something related to logic, theory, and especially technology. Therefore, at that time, I did the most important decision that I have ever made until now, I drop my dream university and move to RMIT University to follow the degree that was more suitable for me. I feel I found who I really is when I study all the things in IT field. When studying  them, I can learn not only precise knowledge but also logical thinking that I know that they extremely important with my life in the future. </p>

                       <p class="about">+ I was living in a nuclear family in Haiphong which is known as flamboyant flowers city.. Since I was a little kid, I have always wanted to be a Victoria's Secret supermodel. But after my mom and dad objected me for being a professional model, they had convinced me to a programming course because they wanted me to follow my brother's footsteps to become a web  development. Moreover, my uncle and aunty are IT postgraduate students in Australia so I can get a lot of guidance and support. At first, I was shock due to the fact that I didn't have any experience in IT and it is also quite difficult for a girl to learn it. Therefore, after I have studied a few weeks in RMIT which has good bachelor's degree, I found it was pretty interesting and curious about this subject and I realized that IT plays an crucial role in the area of 4.0. Besides, I'm an introverted and scrared of criticism kind of person but thankfully my team as well as our team leader Hoang has helped us a lot in communication between members as well as guiding and support us during the progress. Even though our team are still shy and sometimes fail to keep an appointment, we are going to try our best to give the best results.  Last but not least, we are gaining experience and knowledge to be graduate with a decent degree in RMIT to have a better career. </p>

                       <p class="about">+  I was born and raised in Ha Noi since birth in an extended family who had lived on this land for 5 generations. As a kid, I have always taken an interest in the world of technology. My first interaction with IT came from my father, who is a huge fan of Steve Jobs and Apple. I remembered the first time holding, experiencing the very first Iphone, wondering how something of its size could be capable of fulfilling so many functions, needs that people had always longing from a more than portable device. The more I grew the more I interacted with IT. My interest in games such as GTA, FIFA and PES led me to the modding community, thus began my first steps into coding. I am not the kind of person that is capable of creating a whole total mod pack, though. I specialized in helping people with the optimization and installation of mod packs into the base games, which sometimes earned me some quick bucks. Throughout all those experience, alongside with advices from my father, who had spent more that half of his life in the banking industry working to the top, I realized that IT was the best choice for me with the hopes of catching and riding the waves of the 4.0 era. I would described my self as a friendly, somewhat easy-going but introverted kind of person, and often find difficulties getting my points across to other people. Thankfully my team was more than helpful with my problems, often encouraging and keeping an ear out to my proposals, and it was nice to meet people of the same interest and goals like myself. I am responsible for testing and giving  feedbacks to our application, as well as setting up online and face-to-face meetings between members to discuss our next moves. </p>
                       <h4 class="tên">- TRAN LAM (s3927213) (POOR CONTRIBUTION)  </h4>
                       <p class="about">+  I was born in Hanoi and am living with my sister and parents. I have always had a fascination with the Internet and computers since I was a little boy. I spent much time searching for  information on the Web that I could not get at school and it actually helped me a lot with my study. During my high school years, I almost always had my smartphone by my side to surf the Web any time I could and my interest in IT grew. Eventually, I realized my personality and skills might be suitable for working in the IT industry, which led me to choosing this course at RMIT. I do not have much basic knowledge on the subject but I will try my best to make sure that I do not get left behind. I can be shy and indecisive at times but I can contribute to the team if I was given the chance. I did feel a bit nervous working on this project at first but luckily for me, I had my teammates by my side who showed a lot of support for one another and helped guide each other through the processes. Everyone else put all of their efforts into making the project so I have to take it seriously or my teammates will go down with me. I have to thank every member for their hard work, especially Duong Viet Hoang, our team leader, for giving so much input on the project and showing good leadership skills.    </p>
