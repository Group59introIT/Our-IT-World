                       <p class="about">MECA is the combination of 02 first letters of 02 words which are MENTAL and CARE. This is also the mission of our application, TELLME will always be your friend and always care about your mental health and desire to heal it. Another meaning of ME(CA) is me - myself. We want whenever listening to our name, everyone will know that each member in MECA truly cares about our customers and always strive to make benefits to the community.</p>
                       <h4 class="tên">DUONG VIET HOANG (s3962514) </h4>
                       <p class="about">In high school, I was unclear if I would pursue a career in information technology or another tech-related field. The only thing I wanted at the time was a high score on the national high school exam and admission to a prestigious Vietnamese institution. And I succeeded; fortunately, I qualified to attend Foreign Trade University, an economics university, as I was among the top 1% of exam achievers. I was the one who enjoyed working outside of school hours and engaging in clubs. I had the opportunity to learn one thing: if I work a variety of professions, I might not know what I want to do for a living in the future, but I will know what is not fit to me. After a year at my old university, I came to the conclusion that economics was not the right field for me. Instead, my true passions lie in the areas of logic, theory, and technology. As a result, I made the most significant decision of my life at that point when I transferred to RMIT University to pursue the degree that best suited my passion instead of continuing at my ideal university. When I studied everything in the IT industry, I felt like I discovered who I truly am. I can obtain exact information and logical thinking through studying them, and I am aware of how crucial these skills will be for the rest of my life.
                                        <br><br>Group process: In general, As a leader of the team, I am confident to say that my team works well together. Even though the workload of this project is not light, which is even much more compared with the previous one, our team has been trying hard to accomplish every single given task. One of the reasons for this is that we have more time to know each other, and this time, it not spend not too much time for us to get familiar with the working style of each member. However, there is still some obstacle and challenges but everything is solved with the support of every member. Communication might be one which is the massive problem that we faced. It was not easy for us to set a specific time to hold a meeting for a work date, so on the very first of work, misinterpretations always happen. However, we try to solve it through the online meeting, and frequent updating, which works well with my team. </p>
                       <h4 class="tên">VU THU HIEN (s3979359) </h4>
                       <p class="about">I was living in a nuclear family in Hai Phong, which is known as the "flamboyant flower city." I have always wanted to be a model, but my mom and dad objected to me becoming a professional model. They convinced me to study IT because they wanted me to follow in my brother’s footsteps and become a web developer. Moreover, I may receive a lot of guidance and assistance because my aunt and uncle are IT postgraduate students in Australia. At first, I was a little confused since I did not have any experience in IT, and it was also frustrating and stressful for a girl to learn. However, nearly after 3 months of studying at RMIT, I found IT plays a crucial role in the area of 4.0, and it is also interesting, although it is still hard for me to follow. Moreover, I have plenty of good memories with my friends at RMIT. In addition, my teammate has guided and supported me during the process. Even though there are some changes in the number of members, we have tried our best to give the best results. Lastly, we are all seeking to graduate from RMIT with a bachelor's degree in the IT area and obtain experience through projects and internships by the time we have achieved our professional objectives.
                        <br><br>Group process: In my opinion, we had trouble managing our work at the beginning of our project because of some changes in the team members, but I thought we handled it quite effectively and were supportive of one another. In fact, our teamwork and time management abilities dramatically improved starting with the second assignment. We regularly hold online meetings to discuss any issues that our members may be having with their report, website, or presentation slides. But during the instructional sessions, we can engage in person, and I believe that this increased the effectiveness of our work. Even if there are still some issues among our team, I believe we did well overall and delivered the finest outcomes.

                       <h4 class="tên">NGUYEN THANH TUNG (s3979489)</h4>
                       <p class="about">Born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, I came to the capital city of Vietnam at the age of 10 when my father got a breakthrough in his career, landing the job as the vice chairman of Napas (National Payment Services). His idol is Steve Jobs, the late founder and CEO of Apple, and he just couldn’t help himself buying and collecting Apple products, thus came my first experience with the world of Information Technology. I still vividly remember the first time holding the Iphone 3, amazed, stunned, taken aback by how something of its size can be capable of so many functions. For me, it was a simple decision to choose RMIT and the IT bachelor program since my brother is currently in his last year of this program, and throughout his studying I heard nothing but praises about the school and the environment from him, which greatly persuaded me to follow in his footsteps. I am currently working part-time as a moderator for a Facebook page focusing on the competitive aspect of the popular online games League of Legends and since this is a job that requires a lot of time sitting in front of the computer screen spectating games closely, I found social interactions especially challenging. Thankfully, I managed to come across this wonderful group of people that are more than understanding of my condition, helping ourselves toward the desired goals. 
                        <br><br>Group process: In my opinion, I think most of us had done a great job despite the circumstances. We found ourselves at a later starting point in comparison to the other groups, having to deal with the sudden leave of one of our members post-Christmas break and the pressure of time was relevant throughout the project. Hoang would be responsible for the coding of the website, as well as testing the prototype and the Git repository; Hien would take on the job of organizing team meetings and communication, guiding and adjusting the expectation of the project while me and Lam had the job of handling the main part of the report. Unlike the last projects, this time we actually had the chance to meet each other face-to-face as well as checking up on each member’s progress and share documents on Messenger, and in my opinion it really helped improve the chemistry of the group. With the team missing one member, the amount of workload on the other four was increased, and while me, Hoang and Hien took it without much problem, for Lam it proved to be troublesome. From only having a minor role in the first project, Lam saw himself taking on the Plan, Progress and Roles sections of the report, and to put it in a lighter tone, his initial product did not live up to our expectations, and a lot of arguments and disagreements came after. In the end, we decided to put it aside and help Lam to fulfill his role in the project. I think in the future, we should be more realistic about the amount of expectation that should be put on each member, and be more truthful to each other since one’s miscommunication with the others nearly spelt doom on the whole project.

                       <p class="about">I was born and raised in Hanoi and am currently living with my sister and parents. I’ve always had a fascination with the Internet and computers since I was a little boy. I spent much time searching for information on the Web that I couldn’t get at school and it actually helped me a lot with my study. During my high school years, I almost always had my smartphone by my side to surf the Web any time I could and my interest in IT grew. Eventually, I realized my personality and skills might be suitable for working in the IT industry, which led me to choosing this course at RMIT. I don’t have much basic knowledge on the subject but I will try my best to make sure that I don’t get left behind. I can be shy and indecisive at times but I will not let that stop me from doing my best in any work given to me. I was worried at first when I saw the amount of work assigned to me but then I realized I had my teammates by my side. I had some trouble in communicating with them but they were still willing to help me through any problem I faced. Everyone else was working hard so I could not let myself become a burden to the whole group and made a strong effort in completing my task. Now I am beginning to grow an interest in mobile apps so maybe I will pursue a career as an app developer in the future. To achieve that dream, I will have to work hard to graduate from RMIT with a decent degree.                        
                        <br><br>Group process: In my opinion, our team put in a lot of effort and did a good job in this group project. Everyone worked hard on their task since we all wanted to show our contribution to the team. We mostly interacted on social media but we still helped each other in any way possible. There were some communication issues that caused some problems for the group but we managed to resolve it peacefully. During one of the final days before the project’s deadline, we agreed to meet each  other face-to-face at campus to finish the final parts in our report and correct any mistakes that we missed.  We worked very efficiently that day because we were able to support each other directly in any problem we faced. Our group process did not always go smoothly but we were still able to complete our project in time thanks to the combined effort from every team member.

                        This is the first project we use Git and GitHub in our process, but it takes us not too much time to get familiar with them. Honestly, Git and GitHub help us in every aspect of work such as storage assets, code, and communication between every member… Even though in this project, there is only one member(Hoang) who is assigned to build a website, he also uses GitHub in work for tracking the work process. It was truly convenient for every other member of the team can check and understand more about the workflow. Not to mention that GitHub provide users “GitHub page” which is extremely useful for us to visualize our code into a website page without using another app, or website. </p>

However, the relationships between experts and patients will not be the sole focus. We also want to create a space where patients of different backgrounds and interests can connect with each other and share valuable experience to together get through the obstacles they are facing.</p>

                    <h4 class="tên">Motivation</h4>
                    <p class="about">According to Deputy Health Minister Tran Van Thuan (Le Nga 2022) in celebration of the 2022 World Mental Health Day (October 10th 2022), roughly 15 million Vietnamese had symptoms of mental illnesses, most commonly depression and anxiety. On paper it looks like just something you expected, however, with the lack of understanding and acknowledgement among the Vietnamese citizens on mental health well-being, this creates a whole new problem that proves to be difficult to solve. One of our member’s younger brother is also among those unfortunate enough to encounter this issue. He suffered from both ADHD and extreme anxiety and this greatly affected his ability to concentrate on his study and interacting with people around him, and this led to depression as well. He commonly has to go see a therapist, and my mom had to take greater care of him so much to the point I barely see her outside of family meals. So by getting the issue taken care of in time, we can help prevent any unfortunate consequences that mental health disorders can bring. Furthermore, by having the opportunity to interact with experts not only in the medical field but also in the IT field during the development of the app, we also gained some valuable experiences that are crucial to future studying and career.</p>
                    <h4 class="tên">Landscape (Rivals)</h4>
                    <div class="about">While the idea and execution is still relatively new, there is no lack of potential rivals that share somewhat the same idea as us:<br><br>Talkspace: a website/app that is designed for people to find therapists that can handle the job online. This website uses an algorithm that is based on the answers given by users to match them with a list of available experts that the AI considers suitable. This app also lets people take their therapy sessions online and makes it easy for you to communicate with your therapist by allowing multimedia sharing (text, voice chats, video messages) at the same time offering videos and exercises to help alleviate stress and improve coping skills Outside of therapy sessions. However, with a starting point of 260$ per month (based on the clients), this means people with normal to low income can not really afford the services. Also, since the sessions are performed through the web, patients sometimes find it hard to really relate and feel like the therapist is getting to know you in a way that’s productive. Moreover, when being matched with a therapist, you’re only able to see three options at a time and there’s no guarantee you’ll be matched with your preferred therapist, while we allow you to see a whole list of suitable clients. Last but not least, the services provided by Talkspace are exclusively in English, while we offer services both in English and Vietnamese (Zameena Mejia et al 2022).<br><br>Calm: an app that helps you to achieve a state of relaxation by providing you a massive library of songs, audiobooks, podcasts, life guides and many other forms of sound files. One of the app’s most popular features is “Daily Calm”, a series of ever-changing meditation sessions that focuses on different aspects of mindfulness that is described to be suitable to both beginners and more advanced folks. Moreover, Calm offers a very wide variety of narrators, from the professionals whose job is basically to talk to people to superstars such as LeBron James, Camilla Cabello and Harry Styles. This also brought along some unwanted problems, however. The quality of sessions on Calm is not all consistent, which is especially seen in the celebrity-based contents, which is understandable since either this was not their profession, or they just could not care enough and only do it for the sake of money. The user interface of Calm is claimed to be notoriously bad, with the app making it really tricky for new users to discover that specific content they came for due to the lack of basic search functions. The optimization was rather poor, with the app tendency to freeze after half an hour, oftenly taking a few minutes to load sessions and sometimes a total relaunch is needed (Lindsey Vickers 2021).<br><br>Moodpath: an app which inspects your everyday’s feelings through a list of questions. At the end of every couple of weeks, it writes a report on your mental health for you to give to a mental health specialist. It is very user friendly, and will not take you much time to get used to. Apart from the questionnaire, the app also offers three other sections: ‘insights’, which is a summary of the questions you have answer do far: ‘pause’, a series of guided meditations that can be unlock by paying for a membership of $6.49 per month pf $53.99 per year and ‘discover’ which help you to understand the psychology of feelings. There is not that much negative to say about the app, since it was meant to be used as a supporting tool on your road to recovery and in comparison to the two above this is definitely the simplest and least complex of them all (Brooke Connett 2019).</div>

                    <h4 class="tên">A Aims</h4>
                    <p class="about">Construct a remarkable application for psychotherapy employing AI support that can serve as a great buddy with whom you can feel free to share secret things as well as a mental medication for those who are experiencing psychological problems.</p>
                    <p class="about">According to the Ministry of Health (2020), our country has about 15% of the population with common mental disorders, 3 million people with serious mental disorders. Only 10 most common mental illnesses such as depression, epilepsy, behavioral disorders, schizophrenia... have more than 13 million people. However, the number of people being treated is still very low, only 2-3 people out of 10 people receive treatment. While in the past, depression was commonly known in postpartum women and the elderly, now depression can happen to anyone. Especially the state of depression in adolescents aged 14-29 is at an alarming rate but unfortunately, the healthcare system lacks the capacity to meet patient demand (Ha Linh 2022). As a result, we decided to invent TELLME - is an app made for people looking for internet psychotherapy or someone to talk with. The application offers users psychological self-regulation techniques or suggests suitable, licensed therapists based on the findings of the user's initial psychological state survey.</p>
                    <p class="about">+ Have chances to start a multi-million-dollar business in the IT sector: as a community services application, we could get plenty of cash if there are many people who purchase and using it. We could have the chance to work and cooperate with larger companies or specialists at a professional environment. As we seek to develop AI and virtual assistant technologies that will allow us to enter other industries like healthcare or education, it is also a valuable experience for us to gain.</p>
                    <p class="about">+ A confidential setting where you can receive treatment, tell your tales, and find spiritual healing. Connecting users to therapy techniques from basic to advance with professionals, medical professionals, and psychology consultants, an online psychotherapy application links individuals in need of treatment or basically a place where you can share your daily life and talk with our data-based AI robots. With a team of psychologists in large and small clinics around Vietnam that are very reputable and reliable, it will build the trust of users that they can completely enjoy the psychological treatment service in MECA. Therefore, those who are afraid to go to the doctor or simply because there are not enough clinics, can still feel safe while using this app. Besides, the app will give the user useful advice and a healthy living regimen not only for people who need a psychotherapy but anyone who need a buddy to have a conversation with.</p>
                    <p class="about">+ Get the app to be recognized by the Ministry of Health before it can be marketed, first in Vietnam and then internationally so that it would grow to be a dependable and helpful app for the community.</p>
                    <h4 class="tên">B Plans and Progress</h4>
                    <p class="about">First, we are going to need to assemble a team. The most important figures are the project leader, web designers, front-end and back-end developers, mobile app developers and marketing manager. Once those roles are filled, we can begin the necessary processes in making our app. Other roles will be needed but we will not discuss it until later.<br><br>We have to find professionals from different fields that are willing to cooperate with us on our app. These fields will include industrial design, business development, robotics, … We need the help of hospitals, specifically doctors, psychiatrists, medical professors, and anyone else who can serve as our expert advisors. The consumers will be able to trust the credibility of our software since our advice and diagnosis are backed by real experts in the field.<br><br>To make our app, we will first create the app icon using the Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. Our app’s logo will have its name Tellme along with our symbol that you can see on our slide. To guarantee that the largest number of users can use it on their devices, we want it to be downloadable on both Android and iOS systems. For Android, we will use programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Java, Python or C++, while iOS apps must use Swift or Object-C.<br><br>An AI will collect data from forms containing the user’s age, name, address, the mental problem they have and their current state. Then the AI will analyze the information so it can make accurate diagnoses of the patient's current condition and provide articles explaining the disorder. Users can even have private chats with professionals who specialize in the patients' disorder to ask questions about their mental health issue. Maybe these experts can even give useful advice on how to lessen the effects of the issue. Information on these health problems will be based on the database of the Ministry of the Health so we have to apply for data rights and certification from the Ministry. Also, using machine learning and deep learning will help the AI recognize and analyze from the simplest to the most complicated data and images and provide its final findings as quickly as possible.<br><br>To train an artificial intelligence model, we'll need a dataset which is a collection of various types of data stored in a digital format. How well the machine learning or deep learning model performs depends heavily on the quantity, quality, and relevancy of the dataset. Most Data Scientists and AI developers have to spend about 70% of their time analyzing datasets (Rafiuddin Khan – 2022). It is normally used to support machine learning process with reading or identifying a specific kind of data. Machine learning algorithms would be able to identify relationships, generate understanding, make decisions, and evaluate their decisions based on their training data. AI datasets typically present in rows and columns, with each row containing an observation which can be in the form of text, an image, or a video (StageZero Technologies – 2022).<br><br>To acquire the data needed for our AI training, we will have to ask for licenses to gain access to the database of hospitals in Hanoi and the world if possible. We want to make sure that our data is precise so our AI’s information on mental health issues can be accurate and trustworthy. We will train our AI model until it can produce similar results to a highly trained human doctor. <br><br>After finishing our first demo, we can collaborate with the psychology department of hospitals and mental clinics so they can use it in treating their patients. This is a test to see how well our app performs in real life when treating real patients. If we are lucky and the demo works, the doctors there might promote our app to their patients so our reputation can spread to the public. Once our completed app is published, we will have many clients who already know our name and are eager to use the app.<br><br>Figma will be used to design the UI and UX of the app because it is free and one of the easiest tools to use for making app demos so it is commonly used by inexperienced developers. We will look at other apps’ design to create a general outline for ours but we will make changes. The finished UI and UX design will be sent to our coding team so they can create the app based on this design. <br><br>The app will have a chatbot that can give out recommended articles and exercises based on the information gathered from the chats it had with the user. If the user does not know what their problem is, they can send messages to the chatbot about the symptoms they experienced and it will predict what kind of disorder they have. From there, it can offer some documents that have more in-depth information on the condition and suggest some methods to help the patient.<br><br>For the input and output data, this will require extensive backend computing such as massive database management, memory allocation, and powerful hardware interfacing. Big data can be used here since it can record, handle, and process the data with minimal latency. Our consumers’ private information will be protected carefully and can only be accessed by us, the providers, and the users. If they feel the need to have private chats with the experts on our app, they will have to reveal some information about their condition and themselves to them as well to make these sessions more effective.<br><br>Adding more languages is another consideration since we want our international market to be as wide as possible. We plan to add languages from countries like Greece, Spain, Morocco and Ukraine because these are considered among the most depressed countries in the world  (Wisevoter – 2022). We will not restrict ourselves to just these countries and will seek out more foreign markets that may need our service.<br><br>In the future, we can have additional functions in our app that can aid the patients in more ways. For example, we can add a recommendation section that contains stories about the struggles some patients had to endure because of their condition and how our app helped them during their tough times. This can help motivate other patients who are going through similar situations to take better care of themselves. This is just one of many ideas that we can implement for our app when we have the resource to do it. The users can also contribute by giving some suggestions of their own for a feature in their feedbacks. We are open to new and creative ideas from our consumers, but we will still have to discuss whether they are feasible enough to use. If the added features work, they will improve the user’s experience and show that we are listening to these patients and are trying to satisfy all of their needs.<br><br>Before the app can even go out to the public, various tests will be conducted in order to show us all the problems that we missed and maybe even make some improvements. This app has to be the best version possible because it is for those who are already living in difficulties due to the effects of their mental illnesses. We cannot afford to make any serious mistakes that can potentially affect the user’s experience in a negative way. So, a demo will be released to just some friends and family to fix some issues that we can find from their feedback and add certain adjustments. We want to put in our best efforts to create the most user-friendly platform. There could be smaller bugs that we will not notice before publishing the app so consumers’ responses will be important. They can reveal to us the malfunctions or troubles that the users encountered in our program so we would know what to fix in future updates.</p>
                    <h4 class="tên">C Roles</h4>
                    <p class="about">To efficiently perform tasks and deliver each feature on time in this project, it is necessary for specific roles to be played: Tasks are assigned to each team member, and it is crucial for everyone be responsible for themselves as well as for other members. Therefore, everyone is accountable for arriving at work on time and putting effort into their studies, but our team leader is incurable because he is capable of leading the group and handling any issues or conflicts that other members may experience.</p>
                    <p class="about">The user interface designer plays a crucial role about creation, simplification, and assurance that the app interface is simple, appealing, and understandable for users of all ages are all vital tasks. Moreover, for the application to be accessed, supported, and used as quickly as possible, the interface needs to link to the phone's virtual help.</p>
                    <p class="about">Technical designer: it is necessary for them to have knowledge in AI, data analysis and prototype. The computer has to learn and imbrue with treatments, expression, and user psychology. Gather online data pertinent to the main issue and perform an analysis on it. Besides, they must carefully create an AI robot that is capable of conversing with people who need therapy and those who would like to share their wonderful stories. Lastly, utilizing the data already available, diagnoses will be improved, and each effort will be assessed on new and potential patients.</p>
                    <h4 class="tên">D Scope and Limits</h4>
                    <div class="about">There were three main goals that we wanted to achieve with the application. The first and most difficult task of them all would be to let the Deep Learning AI learn how to identify and diagnose the patients based on their description of symptoms. We have to basically write a whole new database on signs and symptoms of various mental health disorders that the machine can rely on and extract information since there wasn’t one. After that, we would use an algorithm by letting the AI detecting the keywords in the text given by the users and whichever disorders’ description is the closest to the input will be returned and shown alongside in-depth articles explaining the disorder, professionals specializing in that disorders that you can book sessions from and guides to minimize the effects of the problem in the meantime. We spent the whole duration of the course to make it possible, and even spent 2 weeks holding a beta test with the registered clients. We also wanted to make use of the virtual assistants available too (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, …) so by installing the apps, additional commands are also automatically installed into the virtual assistants that let them use the database of the app. Secondly, the UI (User Interface). We wanted to make it as user-friendly as possible. A huge inspiration of our product came from the app “Moodpath” as it was described as one of the best examples of UI designing and we decided to use it as a base before making additions that are suitable for our products such as a search bar, bookmarks and inboxes. Lastly, the introductory website. We know some people have a weird preference to use the web app through Google Chrome, Firefox, etc… rather than installing and launching the app themselves. Unlike many companies that deliberately sabotage their products’ websites so badly that it basically forces the users to install the app on Apple store/ Google Play store, we want the web app to at least deliver the same authentic experience that you get on the app. That’s why we based almost all of our development on the background of our website before translating and bringing it on the app. The website is also used as a beta app where we would let users experience the new things that we want to bring to the product and based on the feedback, make the decision to either update it on the app or not.</div>
                    <h4 class="tên">E Tools and Technologies</h4>
                    <p class="about">Artificial intelligence is created with the aim to simulate the human brain as closely as possible. The AI consisted of specific applications such as expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision. <br><br>Machine / Deep Learning: (Arne Wolfewicz, 2021):<br>+ Machine learning: a term used when computers are fed data to learn from, using algorithms to execute a certain task without heavy human interpretation by recognizing patterns in the data and makes predictions when new data arrives.<br>+ Deep learning: is basically machine learning, but is able to take in and sort out an enormous amount of unstructured data to deliver to users by using an algorithm called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that analyzes data with a logic structure that can overcome machine learning's limit.<br><br>Artificial Neural Network (ANN)(Artificial Neural Network 2022): An artificial neuron network (neural network) is a computational model that simulates the nerve cells in the human brain. It uses learning algorithms to make adjustments by itself - or learns when receiving new information, making it a very effective tool for non-linear statistical data modeling. Deep learning ANNs play an important role in machine learning (ML) and support the broader field of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. <br><br>Big Data (Bridget Botelho et al 2022): Big data consists of structured, semistructured and unstructured data gathered by organizations for the purposes of mining for information and used in machine learning projects, predictive modeling and other advanced analytics applications.<br><br>Systems that process and store big data have become a crucial component of data management structure in organizations, combined with applications that support big data analytics. Big data is often characterized by the three V's:<br>+ The large volume of data that can reach unprecedented heights and sizes;<br>+ The wide variety of data types stored in big data systems; and<br>+ The velocity which is the growth of data, and the resulting importance of it (BIG DATA: THE 3 VS EXPLAINED, 2022).</p>
                    <h4 class="tên">F Testing</h4>
                    <p class="about">This process will determine whether the app is complete and function well or not. After finishing the final process of creating the app, we will test it to ensure that everything will work out without errors and bugs. We decide to test it with volunteers and patients who are currently having mental issues or want to have a friend to talk with to relieve stress. We will go to some medical centers or random places to ask for testing the app by trying to use it. After receiving feedbacks and comments on the use of the application, we will then try to improve some of its features and functions based on the data collected from the feedbacks and start fixing any errors that occur during the testing process. Furthermore, we will cooperate with the psychologists and experts in human’s mental health in order to have an insight into this complex field to and improve services to deal with psychological problems as efficiently and accurately as possible. We will also work with professionals in other fields such as mechatronics, robotics, industrial design to finalize and design the app so that it will fit the market and mass demand. </p>
                    <h4 class="tên">G Risks</h4>
                    <p class="about">As mentioned above, this app took a really deep dive into the field of medical and well-being. So, one real concern for us was how to get the trust and the confidence from the users, just like in hospitals, where the doctors have to first diagnose the symptom of the patients, then direct them on a proper treatment path involving a list of medicines and in more severe cases, surgeries. And gaining customers’ trust is not going to be a linear process, which means we have to think thoroughly about this. First up, in order to help make our product look like a proper high-quality application and not just a watered-down rip-off or a total scam, we actually hired an experienced app developer/designer. Well, not actually ‘hired’ since we received help from Tung’s father, who appeared to be one of the developers behind the popular payment app MoMo, who also assisted us in the development of our website. After that, by advertising our app through emails, we got quite a sizable number of beta testers, which included both therapists and patients from around 10 clinics in Hanoi and while the app was a total mess optimization-wise (which was expected), the feedback were rather positive and the available tools inside the app really help distinguish it from other online communication method such as Zalo or Messenger.</p>
                    <p class="about">One other problem for us was to find suitable clients that work in the field to collaborate with. Since this was a brand new product, there is going to be speculation and a sense of doubt, and the fact that our marketing campaign is basically sending an email to potential customers promoting the product hoping that they will notice does not help at all. We had to chat with over 100 people in different parts of the day, handling requests, questions and concerns about the integrity of our product and it was understandable that most would pull out of further relationships due to the lack of proven statistics, so we were very grateful for the few that stayed with us and believed us.</p>
                    <p class="about">As for the AI, it took quite a time for it to get going smoothly. We use a AI that is dedicated to handling the job of greeting and handling people requests on a rather simple scale while the experts are away or unavailable by having it extracting information from a preset dialogue database, one of the solutions having the bot pre-diagnosing the patients based on the contexts given and suggesting them to a set of guides/tips on the disorder the AI consider being true. However, since it was early days, the accuracy of this pre-diagnosis feature is rather low, and would often create further confusions between patients and doctors due to different diagnoses. Of course, as the time goes the machine would be more likely to get it right than not, in the meantime we decided to give our experts the option to turn pre-diagnosing AI on and off based on the preference, with the default option being off and a caution window that will appear when attempting to turn on. Furthermore, it turned out that the dialogue database we were currently using was rather unsuitable for the app, with users reporting that they sometimes would feel rather uncomfortable interacting with the AI judging from the replies created from its due to involvement of informal or even fault language. Upon further searching, it turns out that the database was created by a group of conversion therapists (Conversion therapy is any emotional or physical therapy used to “cure” or “repair” a person’s attraction to the same sex, or their gender identity and expression)(Shishira Sreenivas et al 2021), meaning it was certain that there would be homophobic contents unfortunately. This was a big shame, due to the fact that 15% of our users consider themselves to be a part of LGBTQ+, and they came here to seek validation that others don’t give them.</p>

                    <p class="about">With this being our second project together, most of the communication difficulties we faced during the first one were not presented any longer. Our group decided to build upon what had already been done in the first project, using a combination of Messenger and Google Meets to effectively discuss and exchanged topics about the project and with my (Tung) health conditions greatly improving post-surgery, we finally managed to agree upon a time to meet through our Messenger group chat. This greatly helped improve our group chemistry at first, as I was finally able to get to know each member properly, bringing us together to weather the upcoming storm as Minh had to suddenly leave the group and reserved his results due to personal reasons. However, things did not go according to plan, and after being unable to sort things out on Google Meets, another face-to-face meeting was set up. There, we had what was probably the most heated debate I had ever seen in my lifetime. The team was pretty much in disarray as every member had a different opinion on how the project proposal should be played out in their minds and none of us decided to give up on our own ways. As a result, Hoang, our group leader said that everyone should still hand in their works to him so he can gather the information and finalize the project layouts, as well as doubling down on his leadership role, meaning he would have the final say in most things. In the end, we managed to scramble a product that came up to the desired standard, and had quite a decent showing in front of the class. It is safe to say though that we will be seeing and working with other people next semester, at least we had a good time and decent scoring.</p>

                        <p class="about">We believe that our team members did their tasks well in this assignment though there was an issue that caused some problems for us. We were assigned with our duties at a group meeting and everyone was mostly pleased with their task. Everyone delivered their works and there certainly were efforts put into them. It was exhausting for us but regardless, we still pushed forward and did the best we can. Some members had to stay up late at night sometimes to get their work done so you can imagine how tired they must have felt. We all want to be supportive of each other and work with a positive attitude to avoid any conflict between members. If any member faces a problem that they cannot handle alone, they can ask the group and we will be willing to assist in any way we can. We of course had to look up many sources for references but we also brainstormed a lot of ideas of our own to use in our app and the presentation slides. The majority of things went smoothly for the most part and we managed to submit our finished project without any delay. The communication between the members may need some work because some members did not actively participate in the group’s discussions and respond to our messages fast enough. This was frustrating as we did not know their opinion on certain subject matters we brought up until much later or whether they looked at the resources we shared with the group. This sometimes resulted in miscommunication in the group, which led to some setbacks but we recovered almost immediately. Eventually, they showed us their completed work and admitted their mistake so there were not any hard feelings among the group. This assignment helped us gain more experience and realize some of our flaws when working in a team. Our teamwork had some issues but we managed to move past it and worked together anyway. We still wish that our team’s communication could have been better to make our teamwork more effective. If all of us are reunited in a future group project, we will address this problem and resolve it quickly. For now, this is the project we have made to present so we hope you like it and appreciate all of our hard work.</p>

                        <p class="about">Since I have some experience from the last project, it does not take me as long to go back to this one. In the end, I believe my work was great because our team can effectively complete the assignment. I gained knowledge on several human resources-related issues, including how to manage people and monitor the workflow of everyone. Designing the UI and UX of the app and doing market research on the industries and topics of our project are some of the tasks I have in this project. It wasn't too difficult for me to complete this because I had the opportunity to participate in our school's UCD during the previous semester, earning me 79 points for that course. This is my time to review all the things I learned and put my abilities into practice. I also have to create a website for our assignment. Because I had never learned website programming, at first I believed that I would design it using a graphic website or application. However, after much consideration, I chose to prepare myself for that position by studying HTML and CSS on my own. I am therefore quite excited to enroll in our school's website programming course and feel very confident about it. In addition, through working on this project, I have gained a great deal of knowledge about the medical field as well as the IT business. This knowledge will be extremely helpful to me in taking care of my family, especially my parents.</p>

                        <p class="about">Writing reflections after each project, in my opinion, can much aid us in improving. Our goal is to create a program that will always care about your mental health and your desire to improve it. Since I was in charge of gathering facts for the description, I read a lot of blogs to develop our idea. Although I have learned a lot throughout the course, I believe that my patience and ability to work well in a group are my most valuable new abilities. In fact, when working in a group, a large amount of labor may be split among team members, and team members can make up for or minimize each other's shortcomings. Even though we occasionally have conflicts, the outcome is still far superior than individual labor. Additionally, this training has helped me to develop a foundational knowledge of CSS and HTML. Overall, I enjoy working with my coworkers because each one of them has a strong desire to help out a teammate who is having trouble with a task.</p>
                        <h4 class="tên">NGUYEN THANH TUNG (s3979489)</h4>
                        <p class="about">First of all, I want to sing the biggest of praises to our captain Hoang for being a commanding captain, encouraging us and making sure that we are going to fulfill the deadline. While there wasn’t any doubt for me with his leadership skills, since it was already on full display during the first project, his bravery and responsibility did not fail to impress me again. With Minh having to leave the country for a while, our group at first doesn’t have a coder that can take the job of making a website for the project. In this hard time, Hoang rose to the occasion and decided to arm himself with all the necessary knowledge to deliver a satisfying product, further proving his status as the leader. Hien also managed to keep up and built on her already excellent work in the first project, while the less said about Lam the better. For me, this project was a clear glow-up from the last. With my health problem finally out of the way, this enables me to finally properly meet and connect with the other members. Having to take on this amount of responsibility came as a rather unpleasant surprise to all of us. however I think I did well to adjust to this with delivering all of my parts on time and satisfying the rather high standards from Hoang. During this project, I also managed to learn and take in important lessons from those that are more experienced than me, mainly in the art of writing reports and citing references, as well as improving my ability to make a speech and presenting our product to the crowd. Once again, I want to thank Hoang and Hien for being so helpful and understanding with my struggles, which play a huge part for my personal success in the project.</p>

                        <p class="about">I had a valuable experience when working with this team during this semester though it did show some of my flaws that I need to overcome. The team’s hospitality and positive energy really surprised me. The other members did their parts exactly as asked and did it with little to no delay so everything went relatively well. However, there were some problems I had when working on my part. I did not communicate much with my team members and took way too long to respond to their messages, which is a big problem since one of the most important aspects of teamwork is communication. The part I was assigned had to be long and required a lot of research so I got overwhelmed by the work at first. The first draft I showed to the group was not very good and I was told to rewrite a few parts. I did not provide my references correctly so the team had to show me how to do it right. This experience made me realize that I still have room to grow so I am determined to improve myself next semester by developing my communication and writing skills more. If I can fix the problems I had in this assignment, I can prove to people that I am a capable team member who has a lot to contribute to the group. </p>
