                       <p class="about">When I was in high school, I did not have any idea whether I will study Information Technology or something related to Technology. At that time, the only thing that I want is that I would get a high mark on the national high school exam and win a place at a top-notch university in Vietnam. And I did it, I was in the top 1% of high-scoring students on that exam and luckily was eligible to study at an economics university which is Foreign Trade University. I was the one who like participating in clubs and doing other extra jobs besides studying at school. There is one thing that I had a chance to know, which is if I do a lot of jobs, I might not know what I like to work for a living in the future, but I will know what did not suitable for me. After a year at my former university, I realized that economics is not appropriate for me, I truly love something related to logic, theory, and especially technology. Therefore, at that time, I did the most important decision that I have ever made until now, I drop my dream university and move to RMIT University to follow the degree that was more suitable for me. I feel I found who I really is when I study all the things in IT field. When studying  them, I can learn not only precise knowledge but also logical thinking that I know that they extremely important with my life in the future. </p>

                       <p class="about">I was living in a nuclear family in Haiphong which is known as flamboyant flowers city. Since I was a little kid, I have always wanted to be a Victoria's Secret supermodel. But after my mom and dad objected me for being a professional model, they had convinced me to a programming course because they wanted me to follow my brother's footsteps to become a web  development. Moreover, my uncle and aunty are IT postgraduate students in Australia so I can get a lot of guidance and support. At first, I was shock due to the fact that I didn't have any experience in IT and it is also quite difficult for a girl to learn it. Therefore, after I have studied a few weeks in RMIT which has good bachelor's degree, I found it was pretty interesting and curious about this subject and I realized that IT plays an crucial role in the area of 4.0. Besides, I'm an introverted and scrared of criticism kind of person but thankfully my team as well as our team leader Hoang has helped us a lot in communication between members as well as guiding and support us during the progress. Even though our team are still shy and sometimes fail to keep an appointment, we are going to try our best to give the best results.  Last but not least, we are gaining experience and knowledge to be graduate with a decent degree in RMIT to have a better career. </p>

                       <p class="about">I was born and raised in Ha Noi since birth in an extended family who had lived on this land for 5 generations. As a kid, I have always taken an interest in the world of technology. My first interaction with IT came from my father, who is a huge fan of Steve Jobs and Apple. I remembered the first time holding, experiencing the very first Iphone, wondering how something of its size could be capable of fulfilling so many functions, needs that people had always longing from a more than portable device. The more I grew the more I interacted with IT. My interest in games such as GTA, FIFA and PES led me to the modding community, thus began my first steps into coding. I am not the kind of person that is capable of creating a whole total mod pack, though. I specialized in helping people with the optimization and installation of mod packs into the base games, which sometimes earned me some quick bucks. Throughout all those experience, alongside with advices from my father, who had spent more that half of his life in the banking industry working to the top, I realized that IT was the best choice for me with the hopes of catching and riding the waves of the 4.0 era. I would described my self as a friendly, somewhat easy-going but introverted kind of person, and often find difficulties getting my points across to other people. Thankfully my team was more than helpful with my problems, often encouraging and keeping an ear out to my proposals, and it was nice to meet people of the same interest and goals like myself. I am responsible for testing and giving  feedbacks to our application, as well as setting up online and face-to-face meetings between members to discuss our next moves. </p>

                       <p class="about">I was born in Hanoi and am living with my sister and parents. I have always had a fascination with the Internet and computers since I was a little boy. I spent much time searching for  information on the Web that I could not get at school and it actually helped me a lot with my study. During my high school years, I almost always had my smartphone by my side to surf the Web any time I could and my interest in IT grew. Eventually, I realized my personality and skills might be suitable for working in the IT industry, which led me to choosing this course at RMIT. I do not have much basic knowledge on the subject but I will try my best to make sure that I do not get left behind. I can be shy and indecisive at times but I can contribute to the team if I was given the chance. I did feel a bit nervous working on this project at first but luckily for me, I had my teammates by my side who showed a lot of support for one another and helped guide each other through the processes. Everyone else put all of their efforts into making the project so I have to take it seriously or my teammates will go down with me. I have to thank every member for their hard work, especially Duong Viet Hoang, our team leader, for giving so much input on the project and showing good leadership skills.    </p>

                        This is the first project we use Git and GitHub in our process, but it takes us not too much time to get familiar with them. Honestly, Git and GitHub help us in every aspect of work such as storage assets, code, and communication between every member… Even though in this project, there is only one member(Hoang) who is assigned to build a website, he also uses GitHub in work for tracking the work process. It was truly convenient for every other member of the team can check and understand more about the workflow. Not to mention that GitHub provide users “GitHub page” which is extremely useful for us to visualize our code into a website page without using another app, or website. </p>

                                <p>With the ever-going flow of this ever-changing world, the last few decades have seen the human body and mind pushed to the absolute limit constantly. This in return stirs up new complications, one of those being the mental health of people, which is often ignored in schools and in workplaces despite the detrimental effects it could bring to a person. That’s why in this project, we decided to create an application that helps to assist people through some of the toughest times of their lives by providing useful services.</p>
                                <p>The main goal of this application is to help bridge the gap between the professionals and those in need, domestically at least. The concept of mental health well-being is still in its infancy in Vietnam, so by closing the gap and improving the understanding of the general public on mental health, we hope to not only solve the problems residing deep within each person but also help create jobs and work for others. However, the relationships between experts and patients will not be the sole focus. We also want to create a space where patients of different backgrounds and interests can connect with each other and share valuable experience to together get through the obstacles they are facing.</p>

                    <h4 class="tên">Motivation</h4>
                    <p class="about">According to Deputy Health Minister Tran Van Thuan in celebration of the 2022 World Mental Health Day (October 10th), roughly 15 million Vietnamese had symptoms of mental illnesses, most commonly depression and anxiety. On paper it looks like just something you expected, however, with the lack of understanding and acknowledgement among the Vietnamese citizens on mental health well-being, this creates a whole new problem that proves to be difficult to solve. My brother is also among those unfortunate enough to encounter this issue. He suffered from both ADHD and extreme anxiety and this greatly affected his ability to concentrate on his study and interacting with people around him, and this led to depression as well. He commonly has to go see a therapist, and my mom had to take greater care of him so much to the point I barely see her outside of family meals. So by getting the issue taken care of in time, we can help prevent any unfortunate consequences that mental health disorders can bring. Furthermore, by having the opportunity to interact with experts not only in the medical field but also in the IT field during the development of the app, we also gained some valuable experiences that are crucial to future studying and career.</p>
                    <h4 class="tên">Landscape (Rivals)</h4>
                    <div class="about">While the idea and execution is still relatively new, there is no lack of potential rivals that share somewhat the same idea as us: <br><br>+ Talkspace: a website/app that is designed for people to find therapists that can handle the job online. This website uses an algorithm that is based on the answers given by users to match them with a list of available experts that the AI considers suitable. This app also lets people take their therapy sessions online and makes it easy for you to communicate with your therapist by allowing multimedia sharing (text, voice chats, video messages) at the same time offering videos and exercises to help alleviate stress and improve coping skills Outside of therapy sessions. However, with a starting point of 260$ per month (based on the clients), this means people with normal to low income can not really afford the services. Also, since the sessions are performed through the web, patients sometimes find it hard to really relate and feel like the therapist is getting to know you in a way that’s productive. Moreover, when being matched with a therapist, you’re only able to see three options at a time and there’s no guarantee you’ll be matched with your preferred therapist, while we allow you to see a whole list of suitable clients. Last but not least, the services provided by Talkspace are exclusively in English, while we offer services both in English and Vietnamese.<br><br>+ Calm: an app that helps you to achieve a state of relaxation by providing you a massive library of songs, audiobooks, podcasts, life guides and many other forms of sound files. One of the app’s most popular features is “Daily Calm”, a series of ever-changing meditation sessions that focuses on different aspects of mindfulness that is described to be suitable to both beginners and more advanced folks. Moreover, Calm offers a very wide variety of narrators, from the professionals whose job is basically to talk to people to superstars such as LeBron James, Camilla Cabello and Harry Styles. This also brought along some unwanted problems, however. The quality of sessions on Calm is not all consistent, which is especially seen in the celebrity-based contents, which is understandable since either this was not their profession, or they just could not care enough and only do it for the sake of money. The user interface of Calm is claimed to be notoriously bad, with the app making it really tricky for new users to discover that specific content they came for due to the lack of basic search functions. The optimization was rather poor, with the app tendency to freeze after half an hour, oftenly taking a few minutes to load sessions and sometimes a total relaunch is needed.<br><br>+ Moodpath: an app which inspects your everyday’s feelings through a list of questions. At the end of every couple of weeks, it writes a report on your mental health for you to give to a mental health specialist. It is very user friendly, and will not take you much time to get used to. Apart from the questionnaire, the app also offers three other sections: ‘insights’, which is a summary of the questions you have answer do far: ‘pause’, a series of guided meditations that can be unlock by paying for a membership of $6.49 per month pf $53.99 per year and ‘discover’ which help you to understand the psychology of feelings. There is not that much negative to say about the app, since it was meant to be used as a supporting tool on your road to recovery and in comparison to the two above this is definitely the simplest and least complex of them all. </div>
                    <p id="section-sub-2">Detail description</p>
                    <h4 class="tên">A Aims</h4>
                    <p class="about">Construct a remarkable application for psychotherapy employing AI support that can serve as a great buddy with whom you can feel free to share secret things as well as a mental medication for those who are experiencing psychological problems.</p>
                    <p class="about">According to the Ministry of Health, our country has about 15% of the population with common mental disorders, 3 million people with serious mental disorders. Only 10 most common mental illnesses such as depression, epilepsy, behavioral disorders, schizophrenia... have more than 13 million people. However, the number of people being treated is still very low, only 2-3 people out of 10 people receive treatment. While in the past, depression was commonly known in postpartum women and the elderly, now depression can happen to anyone. Especially the state of depression in adolescents aged 14-29 is at an alarming rate but unfortunately, the healthcare system lacks the capacity to meet patient demand. As a result, we decided to invent TELLME - is an app made for people looking for internet psychotherapy or someone to talk with. The application offers users psychological self-regulation techniques or suggests suitable, licensed therapists based on the findings of the user's initial psychological state survey.</p>
                    <p class="about">+ Have chances to start a multi-million-dollar business in the IT sector: as a community services application, we could get plenty of cash if there are many people who purchase and using it. We could have the chance to work and cooperate with larger companies or specialists at a professional environment. As we seek to develop AI and virtual assistant technologies that will allow us to enter other industries like healthcare or education, it is also a valuable experience for us to gain.</p>
                    <p class="about">+ A confidential setting where you can receive treatment, tell your tales, and find spiritual healing. Connecting users to therapy techniques from basic to advance with professionals, medical professionals, and psychology consultants, an online psychotherapy application links individuals in need of treatment or basically a place where you can share your daily life and talk with our data-based AI robots. With a team of psychologists in large and small clinics around Vietnam that are very reputable and reliable, it will build the trust of users that they can completely enjoy the psychological treatment service in MECA. Therefore, those who are afraid to go to the doctor or simply because there are not enough clinics, can still feel safe while using this app. Besides, the app will give the user useful advice and a healthy living regimen not only for people who need a psychotherapy but anyone who need a buddy to have a conversation with.</p>
                    <p class="about">+ Get the app to be recognized by the Ministry of Health before it can be marketed, first in Vietnam and then internationally so that it would grow to be a dependable and helpful app for the community.</p>
                    <h4 class="tên">B Plans and Progress</h4>
                    <h4 class="tên">C Roles</h4>
                    <p class="about">To efficiently perform tasks and deliver each feature on time in this project, it is necessary for specific roles to be played: Tasks are assigned to each team member, and it is crucial for everyone be responsible for themselves as well as for other members. Therefore, everyone is accountable for arriving at work on time and putting effort into their studies, but our team leader is incurable because he is capable of leading the group and handling any issues or conflicts that other members may experience.</p>
                    <p class="about">The user interface designer plays a crucial role about creation, simplification, and assurance that the app interface is simple, appealing, and understandable for users of all ages are all vital tasks. Moreover, for the application to be accessed, supported, and used as quickly as possible, the interface needs to link to the phone's virtual help.</p>
                    <p class="about">Technical designer: it is necessary for them to have knowledge in AI, data analysis and prototype. The computer has to learn and imbrue with treatments, expression, and user psychology. Gather online data pertinent to the main issue and perform an analysis on it. Besides, they must carefully create an AI robot that is capable of conversing with people who need therapy and those who would like to share their wonderful stories. Lastly, utilizing the data already available, diagnoses will be improved, and each effort will be assessed on new and potential patients.</p>
                    <h4 class="tên">D Scope and Limits</h4>
                    <div class="about">There were three main goals that we wanted to achieve with the application. The first and most difficult task of them all would be to let the Deep Learning AI learn how to identify and diagnose the patients based on their description of symptoms. We have to basically write a whole new database on signs and symptoms of various mental health disorders that the machine can rely on and extract information since there wasn’t one. After that, we would use an algorithm by letting the AI detecting the keywords in the text given by the users and whichever disorders’ description is the closest to the input will be returned and shown alongside in-depth articles explaining the disorder, professionals specializing in that disorders that you can book sessions from and guides to minimize the effects of the problem in the meantime. We spent the whole duration of the course to make it possible, and even spent 2 weeks holding a beta test with the registered clients. We also wanted to make use of the virtual assistants available too (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, …) so by installing the apps, additional commands are also automatically installed into the virtual assistants that let them use the database of the app. Secondly, the UI (User Interface). We wanted to make it as user-friendly as possible. A huge inspiration of our product came from the app “Moodpath” as it was described as one of the best examples of UI designing and we decided to use it as a base before making additions that are suitable for our products such as a search bar, bookmarks and inboxes. Lastly, the introductory website. We know some people have a weird preference to use the web app through Google Chrome, Firefox, etc… rather than installing and launching the app themselves. Unlike many companies that deliberately sabotage their products’ websites so badly that it basically forces the users to install the app on Apple store/ Google Play store, we want the web app to at least deliver the same authentic experience that you get on the app. That’s why we based almost all of our development on the background of our website before translating and bringing it on the app. The website is also used as a beta app where we would let users experience the new things that we want to bring to the product and based on the feedback, make the decision to either update it on the app or not.</div>

                    <h4 class="tên">F Testing</h4>
                    <p class="about">This process will determine whether the app is complete and function well or not. After finishing the final process of creating the app, we will test it to ensure that everything will work out without errors and bugs. We decide to test it with volunteers and patients who are currently having mental issues or want to have a friend to talk with to relieve stress. We will go to some medical centers or random places to ask for testing the app by trying to use it. After receiving feedbacks and comments on the use of the application, we will then try to improve some of its features and functions based on the data collected from the feedbacks and start fixing any errors that occur during the testing process. Furthermore, we will cooperate with the psychologists and experts in human’s mental health in order to have an insight into this complex field to and improve services to deal with psychological problems as efficiently and accurately as possible. We will also work with professionals in other fields such as mechatronics, robotics, industrial design to finalize and design the app so that it will fit the market and mass demand. </p>
                    <h4 class="tên">G Risks</h4>
                    <p class="about">As mentioned above, this app took a really deep dive into the field of medical and well-being. So, one real concern for us was how to get the trust and the confidence from the users, just like in hospitals, where the doctors have to first diagnose the symptom of the patients, then direct them on a proper treatment path involving a list of medicines and in more severe cases, surgeries. And gaining customers’ trust is not going to be a linear process, which means we have to think thoroughly about this. First up, in order to help make our product look like a proper high-quality application and not just a watered-down rip-off or a total scam, we actually hired an experienced app developer/designer. Well, not actually ‘hired’ since we received help from Tung’s father, who appeared to be one of the developers behind the popular payment app MoMo, who also assisted us in the development of our website. After that, by advertising our app through emails, we got quite a sizable number of beta testers, which included both therapists and patients from around 10 clinics in Hanoi and while the app was a total mess optimization-wise (which was expected), the feedback were rather positive and the available tools inside the app really help distinguish it from other online communication method such as Zalo or Messenger.</p>
                    <p class="about">One other problem for us was to find suitable clients that work in the field to collaborate with. Since this was a brand new product, there is going to be speculation and a sense of doubt, and the fact that our marketing campaign is basically sending an email to potential customers promoting the product hoping that they will notice does not help at all. We had to chat with over 100 people in different parts of the day, handling requests, questions and concerns about the integrity of our product and it was understandable that most would pull out of further relationships due to the lack of proven statistics, so we were very grateful for the few that stayed with us and believed us.</p>
                    <p class="about">As for the AI, it took quite a time for it to get going smoothly. We use a AI that is dedicated to handling the job of greeting and handling people requests on a rather simple scale while the experts are away or unavailable by having it extracting information from a preset dialogue database, one of the solutions having the bot pre-diagnosing the patients based on the contexts given and suggesting them to a set of guides/tips on the disorder the AI consider being true. However, since it was early days, the accuracy of this pre-diagnosis feature is rather low, and would often create further confusions between patients and doctors due to different diagnoses. Of course, as the time goes the machine would be more likely to get it right than not, in the meantime we decided to give our experts the option to turn pre-diagnosing AI on and off based on the preference, with the default option being off and a caution window that will appear when attempting to turn on. Furthermore, it turned out that the dialogue database we were currently using was rather unsuitable for the app, with users reporting that they sometimes would feel rather uncomfortable interacting with the AI judging from the replies created from its due to involvement of informal or even fault language. Upon further searching, it turns out that the database was created by a group of conversion therapists (Conversion therapy is any emotional or physical therapy used to “cure” or “repair” a person’s attraction to the same sex, or their gender identity and expression), meaning it was certain that there would be homophobic contents unfortunately. This was a big shame, due to the fact that 15% of our users consider themselves to be a part of LGBTQ+, and they came here to seek validation that others don’t give them.</p>

                    <p class="about">With this being our second project together, most of the communication difficulties we faced during the first one were not presented any longer. Our group decided to build upon what had already been done in the first project, using a combination of Messenger and Google Meets to effectively discuss and exchanged topics about the project and with my (Tung) health conditions greatly improving post-surgery, we finally managed to agree upon a time to meet through our Messenger group chat. This greatly helped improve our group chemistry at first, as I was finally able to get to know each member properly, bringing us together to weather the upcoming storm as Minh had to suddenly leave the group and reserved his results due to personal reasons. However, things did not go according to plan, and after being unable to sort things out on Google Meets, another face-to-face meeting was set up. There, we had what was probably the most heated debate I had ever seen in my lifetime. The team was pretty much in disarray as every member had a different opinion on how the project proposal should be played out in their minds and none of us decided to give up on our own ways. As a result, Hoang, our group leader said that everyone should still hand in their works to him so he can gather the information and finalize the project layouts, as well as doubling down on his leadership role, meaning he would have the final say in most things. In the end, we managed to scramble a product that came up to the desired standard, and had quite a decent showing in front of the class. It is safe to say though that we will be seeing and working with other people next semester, at least we had a good time and decent scoring.</p>

In this section, users will be offered a massive number of music, podcasts, and movies which are mainly for chilling and relaxing. The chatbot is one of the key features of TELLME, so Machine Learning technology is the aspect that our team has to enhance every single day. We want our AI will be more intelligent to give users more comfortable and smarter conversations. It would be amazing if the chatbot will also select a suitable coach for users by collecting data such as their personality, age, gender, and location… from users. We also are going to develop a side application for only our doctors/coaches for effective supervision, this app will help them store their patients’ medical records. Also, by applying AI, this app will be an effective partner with doctors/coaches, it will help them in diagnosing or prescribing their patients. </p>

                        <p class="about">We believe that our team members did their tasks well in this assignment though there was an issue that caused some problems for us. We were assigned with our duties at a group meeting and everyone was mostly pleased with their task. Everyone delivered their works and there certainly were efforts put into them. It was exhausting for us but regardless, we still pushed forward and did the best we can. Some members had to stay up late at night sometimes to get their work done so you can imagine how tired they must have felt. We all want to be supportive of each other and work with a positive attitude to avoid any conflict between members. If any member faces a problem that they cannot handle alone, they can ask the group and we will be willing to assist in any way we can. We of course had to look up many sources for references but we also brainstormed a lot of ideas of our own to use in our app and the presentation slides. The majority of things went smoothly for the most part and we managed to submit our finished project without any delay. The communication between the members may need some work because some members did not actively participate in the group’s discussions and respond to our messages fast enough. This was frustrating as we did not know their opinion on certain subject matters we brought up until much later or whether they looked at the resources we shared with the group. This sometimes resulted in miscommunication in the group, which led to some setbacks but we recovered almost immediately. Eventually, they showed us their completed work and admitted their mistake so there were not any hard feelings among the group. This assignment helped us gain more experience and realize some of our flaws when working in a team. Our teamwork had some issues but we managed to move past it and worked together anyway. We still wish that our team’s communication could have been better to make our teamwork more effective. If all of us are reunited in a future group project, we will address this problem and resolve it quickly. For now, this is the project we have made to present so we hope you like it and appreciate all of our hard work.</p>
